This project is related to prediction of the person will buy a car or not. I am trying to make a project to find that the user will buy a car or not with respect to age,gender and annual salary. The dataset is downloaded from kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielsantello/cars-purchase-decision-dataset). The dataset contains 5 columns user id, Gender,Age,Annual Salary and Purchased. Purchased is dependent feature and other four columns are independent feature.The Gender data is string type and other column are integer type.
There are moving ahead with different steps like knowing data, cleaning and transforming data, and finally predicting with the help of classification model.

The downloaded data from kaggle is attached to this repo in csv format and the code that use to predict is also attached.
In the machine learning part I have used decision tree as well as random forest classifier. But from the result random forest classifier works better than decision tree classifier. But still I have attached a code in the notebook.
